## Robust-LiDAR-Inertial-Re-Localization

## Motivation 
Autonomous robots require accurate localization in GPS-denied environments like
indoors or urban canyons.GNSS-INS systems are prone to failure in these conditions,
while real-time SLAM often drift without loop closures
Map-based localization offers a stable and accurate alternative, but it faces several
key challenges:

1. <srong>Real-time performance and Scalability</strong>: Handling high-resolution 3D maps and
    computing scan-to-map registration efficiently.

2. <strong>Drift correction</strong>: Fusing local motion estimation with global map constraints while
preserving consistency.

3. <strong>Dynamic environments</strong>: Removing or mitigating the effect of moving objects
during scan matching.

4. Localization failures in feature-sparse or unmapped transition zones.

## Contribution
This thesis presents a robust and real-time localization framework for GNSS-denied
environments by fusing LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (FAST-LIO2) with multithreaded
NDT-based map matching using a sliding-window factor graph. It introduces a
scalable submap management strategy and integrates dynamic object removal via
deep learning, enabling consistent pose estimation even in dynamic, degraded, or
feature-sparse areas. The system achieves centimeter- to decimeter-level accuracy
across diverse datasets, maintaining low-latency performance suitable for real-
world autonomous navigation. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed
method not only surpasses standalone odometry and SLAM baselines but also
outperforms recent state-of-the-art map-based localization approaches in accuracy,
robustness, and scalability.

## Conclusions and Future Work

1. <strong>Accurate & Drift-Free</strong>:Achieves sub-decimeter accuracy by fusing FAST-LIO2 and NDT with a sliding-window factor graph, effectively reducing drift without loop closures.
2. <strog>Real-Time & Scalable</strong>: Maintains less than 23 ms latency using multithreaded NDT and dynamic submap loading. Sliding window factor graph optimization remains bounded regardless of trajectory length.
3. <strong>Robust to Challenges</strong>: Dynamic object removal improves convergence, and fused graph keeps localization stable even when scan matching fails.
4. <strong>Limitations & Future Work</strong>: Assumes a known initial pose and a static map. Future directions include global
re-localization, adaptive
